# AI-3018: Create an agent with Copilot Studio

Welcome to your AI-3018: Copilot Foundations workshop! We’ve prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Microsoft Copilot Studio and its capabilities. Let’s begin by making the most of this experience.

# Lab 01: Create an Agent with Copilot Studio

### Overall Estimated timing: 30 Minutes

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will gain practical experience in creating and deploying an AI-powered agent using Microsoft Copilot Studio. You will start by building a simple agent to handle expense-related queries, then extend its functionality by managing topics, adding knowledge sources, and enabling Generative AI responses. Finally, you will publish the agent to a demo website where it can be tested interactively.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. **Create an agent:** Configure a new Copilot Studio agent with a name, tone, and initial responses to handle expense-related queries.

2. **Manage topics in your agent:** Explore system and custom topics, and create a new topic to provide specific contact details for expense claims.

3. **Add a knowledge source for Generative AI responses:** Upload a document as a knowledge source to enable the agent to generate accurate, citation-backed answers.

4. **Publish your agent:** Deploy the agent to a demo website and test it with real user queries.
